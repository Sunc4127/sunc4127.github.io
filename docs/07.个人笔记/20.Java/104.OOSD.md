## Paradigms 



<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Sunc4127/image-hosting/202112071509320.png" alt="image-20211207150938272" style="zoom: 25%;" />

-   There are many paradigms





<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Sunc4127/image-hosting/202112071510853.png" alt="image-20211207151015815" style="zoom:25%;" />



-   Different languages support different paradigms



<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Sunc4127/image-hosting/202112071510794.png" alt="image-20211207151040748" style="zoom:25%;" /> 

-   In OOSD, everything is based on the concept of ```Object```
-   Objects are units that contain
    -   ==Data (State)==
    -   ==Methods (Behavior) (operation on the date)==





<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Sunc4127/image-hosting/202112071514249.png" alt="image-20211207151437208" style="zoom:25%;" />

-   Object-oriented: 
    -   Complex
    -   data and behavior are in a single object 
-   Functional: keep them separate



<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Sunc4127/image-hosting/202112071517115.png" alt="image-20211207151741067" style="zoom:25%;" />

-   That is, it depends 
-   It depends on the problem one is trying to solve 
-   No paradigm works best in all situations 
-   No such a thing as ```one size fits all ```







## Benefits of OOSD

-   Modular 
    -   Reduced complexity 
    -   Easier maintenance 
    -   Code reuse 
    -   Faster development 





## Classes

-   **Class** 

    -   A blueprint/template for creating objects 

-   **Object** 

    -   An instance of a class

    

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Sunc4127/image-hosting/202112081451361.png" alt="image-20211208145106321" style="zoom: 25%;" />

-   **Methods** can change the value of **fields** 
-   Different car instances have different states 
    -   They are independent objects stored in different locations of memory 



-   Example: create the TextBox class 

```java
public class TextBox {
  // declare field
  // should initialize the field to avoid null pointer exception
  public String text = "";

  public void setText(String text) {
    this.text = text;
  }

  public void clear() {
    // don't need to use 'this'
    text = "";
  }
}
```

-   Example: create TextBox objects 

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // use 'var' to replace 'TextBox'
        var textBox1 = new TextBox();
        textBox1.setText("Box 1");
        System.out.println(textBox1.text.toLowerCase());

        // they are completely independent of each other
        var textBox2 = new TextBox();
        textBox2.setText("Box 2");
        System.out.println(textBox2.text.toUpperCase());
    }
}
```







## Memory Allocation

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Sunc4127/image-hosting/202112081523789.png" alt="image-20211208152347746" style="zoom:25%;" />

-   **Heap** store objects 
-   **Stack** store primitives short-lived variables (store references to objects on the heap)

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // the newly created object is stored on the heap;
        // the address of the text object is stored on the stack; so 'textBox1' is a reference type 
        var textBox1 = new TextBox();
        var textBox2 = textBox1; // reference the same TextBox object
        textBox2.setText("Box 2");
        System.out.println(textBox1.text); // get "Box 2"
    }
}
```

-   All memory on the stack will be immediately removed after finishing executing the main function
-   That is, memory deallocation is automatically handled by Java       
-   **Garbage collector** will remove unused objects on the heap







## Encapsulation

-   Bundle the data and methods that operate on the data in a single unit

-   By clicking the lightbulb, IntelliJ can help to create getters and setters 







## Abstraction

-   **Reduce complexity** by hiding unnecessary details 
    -   Hide the implementation details of a class and treat it as a **black box** 
    -   Have a simple interface to work with 







## Coupling 

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Sunc4127/image-hosting/202112091441074.png" alt="image-20211209144155989" style="zoom:15%;" />

-   The **level of dependency** among classes 
-   The more  classes are coupled to each other, the more costly our changes are going to be
-   By reducing the coupling, we can reduce the impact of changes 
    -   Reduce coupling points by reducing the number of unnecessary getter & setter functions 



```java
public class Browser {
  // only navigate is public
  public void navigate(String address) {
    String ip = findIpAddress(address);
    String html = sendHttpRequest(ip);
    System.out.println(html);
  }

  // hide from other classes, only used internally
  private String sendHttpRequest(String ip) {
    return "<html></html>";
  }

  // hide from other classes, only used internally
  private String findIpAddress(String address) {
    return "127.0.0.1";
  }
}
```

-   By abstracting away complex internal implementation, we have reduced coupling among classes







## Constructor

-   This is wrong:

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Sunc4127/image-hosting/202112091504751.png" alt="image-20211209150440710" style="zoom:25%;" />

-   All necessary parameters should be set when creating the object 

```java
// A Constructor method 
public Employee(int baseSalary, int hourlyRate) {
    setBaseSalary(baseSalary); // data validation
    setHourlyRate(hourlyRate); // data validation
    numberOfEmployees++;
}

// In so doing, the main class looks like this: 
public static void main (String[] args) {
    var employee = new Employee(50_000, 20);
}
```







## Method Overloading

```java
public int calculateWage(int extraHours) {
    return baseSalary + (getHourlyRate() * extraHours);
}

public double calculateWage(double extraHours) {
    return baseSalary + (getHourlyRate() * extraHours);
}
```







## Constructor Overloading

```java
public Employee(int baseSalary) {
    // reference to the method down below 
    this(baseSalary, 0);
}

public Employee(int baseSalary, int hourlyRate) {
    setBaseSalary(baseSalary);
    setHourlyRate(hourlyRate);
    numberOfEmployees++;
}
```

-   Use ```Command + P``` to see different constructors

## Static Members

-   A class can have two types of members
    -   Instance members 
        -   Belong to instances or objects 
        -   Instance members like variables can be accessed by using  dot operator 
    -   Static members (Class members)
        -   The **fields** and **methods** that belong to a class, not an object 
            -   Static methods can only use static variables 
            -   It cannot use instance members because they belong to instances 
        -   Independent of objects 
        -   Cannot be accessed by using dot operator on an object 
        -   Represent a concept that should be in a single place 
            -   This concept does not belong to any individual employee 
        -   The **main method** is static because Java runtime is able to directly call this method without having to create a new object 

```java 
// Instance Variable 
var employee = new Employee();
employee.name = "Scott";

// Static Variable 
employee.numberOfEmployees = 100; // ❌ doesn't work, inaccessible 
System.out.println(Employee.numberOfEmployees); // ✅ works
```



## Q & A

1.   What is the difference between a **class** and an **object**?
     -   A class is a **blueprint** or template for creating objects.
     -   An object is an instance of a class.
2.   What does **instantiating** mean? 
     -   Instantiating means **creating an instance of a class**: new Customer()
3.   What is the difference between stack and heap memory? How are they managed?
     -   Stack is used for storing **primitive types** (numbers, boolean and character) and variables that store **references** to objects in the heap. 
     -   Variables stored in the stack are **immediately cleared** when they go out of scope (eg when a method finishes execution). 
     -   Objects stored in the heap get **removed later** on when they’re no longer references. This is done by Java’s **garbage collector**.
4.   What are the problems of procedural code? How does object-oriented  programming help solve these problems? 
     -   **Big classes** with several **unrelated methods** focusing on different concerns and responsibilities. 
     -   These methods often have **several parameters**.
     -   You often see the same group of **parameters repeated** across these methods. 
     -   All you see is procedures calling each other **passing arguments around**.
     -   ==
     -   By applying object-oriented programming techniques, we **extract** these repetitive parameters and declare them as fields in our classes. 
     -   Our classes will then **encapsulate** both the data and the operations on the data (methods). 
     -   As a result, our methods will have fewer parameters and our code will be **cleaner** and more **reusable**.  
5.   What is encapsulation? 
     -   Encapsulation is the first principle of object-oriented programming. 
     -   It suggests that we should **bundle the data and operations on the data inside a single unit (class)**. 
6.   Why should we declare fields as private?  
     -   How we store data in an object is considered an implementation detail. 
     -   We may change how we store the data internally. 
     -   Plus, we don’t want our objects to go into a **bad state (hold bad data)**. 
     -   That’s why we should **declare fields as private and provide getters and or setters only if required**. 
     -   These setters can **ensure our objects don’t go into a bad state by validating the values** that are passed to them. 
7.   What is abstraction? 
     -   Abstraction is the second principle of object-oriented programming. 
     -   It suggests that we should **reduce complexity by hiding the unnecessary implementation details**. 
     -   As a metaphor, think of the remote control of your TV. All the complexity inside the remote control is hidden from you. It’s abstracted away. You just work with a simple interface to control your TV. We want our objects to be like our remote controls. 
8.   What is coupling?  
     -   **Coupling represents the level of dependency between software entities (eg classes)**. 
     -   The more our classes are dependent on each other, the **harder it is to change them**. 
     -   Changing one class may result in **several cascading and breaking changes**.
9.   How does the abstraction principle help reduce coupling?  
     -   **By hiding the implementation details, we prevent other classes from getting affected when we change these details.** 
     -   For example, if the logic board and transistors inside a remote control change from one model to another, we’re not affected. We still use the same interface to work with our TV. 
     -   **Also, reducing these details and exposing fewer methods makes our classes easier to use.** 
     -   For example, remote controls with fewer buttons are easier to use. 
10.   What are constructors?  
      -   Constructors are called when we instantiate our class. 
      -   We use them to initialize our objects. 
      -   Initialization means **putting an object into an early or initial state (eg giving it initial values).** 
11.   What is method overloading?
      -    Method overloading means **declaring a method with the same name but with different signatures**. 
      -   The number, type and order of its parameters will be different. 
12.   What are static methods?
      -   Static methods are accessible via classes, not objects.
