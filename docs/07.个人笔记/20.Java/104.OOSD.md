-   There are many paradigms

-   Different languages support different paradigms

-   In OOSD, everything is based on the concept of ```Object```
-   Objects are units that contain
    -   ==Data (State)==
    -   ==Methods (Behavior) (operation on the date)==

-   Object-oriented: 
    -   Complex
    -   data and behavior are in a single object 
-   Functional: keep them separate

-   That is, it depends 
-   It depends on the problem one is trying to solve 
-   No paradigm works best in all situations 
-   No such a thing as ```one size fits all ```





## Benefits of OOSD

-   Modular 
    -   Reduced complexity 
    -   Easier maintenance 
    -   Code reuse 
    -   Faster development
