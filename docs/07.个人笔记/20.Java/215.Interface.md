## Interface

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Sunc4127/image-hosting/202112271615786.png" alt="image-20211227161548729" style="zoom:25%;" />

-   We use interfaces to build loosely-coupled, extensible and testable applications.

```java
public interface Draggable {
    void drag();
}
```

-   Interface cannot be instantiated like a class 

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	var c = new TaxCalculator() // not allowed 
}
```



**Static Contract** 

-   Classes that implements interfaces are coupled with its contract
-   We should make sure that we do not break the contract frequently 
    -   Because other classes that depend on the contract will be broken
-   One should be careful when designing the contract 
-   Make sure the interface is small and lightweight so they are less likely to change



-   It only contains method declarations, no implementations
    -   It has no implementation code 
    -   It only defines the capabilities that a class should have

-   If we change code in B, A will not be affected, because it knows nothing about B.
    -   That's what called `Programming against Interfaces`



**To create an interface:**

-   Open the `Create New Class` window 
-   Change the kind to `Interface`

**Naming convention (prefix/suffix)**

-   CanXXXXXX
    -   CanCalculateTax
-   XXXable
    -   Draggable 



Example: 

```java
public interface TaxCalculator {
    // public is redundent, they are all public  
    double calculateTax() 
}

public class TaxCalculator2018 implements TaxCalculator {
    private double taxableIncome;

    public TaxCalculator2018(double taxableIncome) {
    	this.taxableIncome = taxableIncome;
  	}
    
    // should use the override key word
    @Override
    public double calculateTax() {
        return taxableIncome * 0.3;
    }
}
```







## Tightly-coupled code

-   Tightly-coupled code is code that is hard to change because there is a strong dependency between the entities (eg classes) in the code. Changing one class may result in several cascading, breaking changes in the code.

```java
public class TaxCalculator {
    private double taxableIncome; 
    
    // // if we add new fields to this method, we need to change the TaxReport class too
    public TaxCalculator(double taxableIncome) {
        this.taxableIncome = taxableIncome;
    }
    
    public double calculateTax() {
        return taxableIncome * 0.4; // if we change this number, other classes will need to be recompiled and redeployed 
    }
}

public class TaxReport {
	private TaxCalculator calculator;

    public TaxReport() {
        this.calculator = TaxCalculator(10_000); // only has one field, but what if we want to add more fields?
    }

    public void show(TaxCalculator calculator) {
        var tax = calculator.calculateTax();
        System.out.println(tax);
    }
}
```





```java
public interface TaxCalculator {}

public class TaxCalculator2018 implements TaxCalculator {}

public class TaxReport { 
    private TaxCalculator calculator;
    public TaxReport() { 
        calculator = new TaxCalculator2018();
    }
}
```

-   Even though the type of the calculator field in `TaxReport` is an interface, we’re initializing this field to an instance of `TaxCalculator2018` in the constructor
-   So, TaxReport is tightly coupled to `TaxCalculator2018`, which is an implementation, not an interface.







## Dependency injection

-   Dependency injection refers to passing or injecting dependencies of a class.

-   We can inject dependencies via 
    -   constructors
    -   setters
    -   and regular methods
-   Our classes should not instantiate their dependencies 

```java
public class TaxReport { 
    private TaxCalculator calculator;
    
    // should not instantiate their dependencies 
    // should just use it (separation of concerns )
    public TaxReport() { 
        calculator = new TaxCalculator2018();
    }
}
```





### Constructor Injection

-   Don't want the class to be dependent on concrete implementation 
-   We want it to be dependent on interfaces 
-   So we use a constructor to inject an interface dependency 

```java
// before
public class TaxReport { 
    private TaxCalculator2018 calculator;
    public TaxReport() { 
        calculator = new TaxCalculator2018();
    }
}

// after 
public class TaxReport { 
    private TaxCalculator calculator;
    
    // constructor injection 
    public TaxReport(TaxCalculator calculator) { 
        this.calculator = calculator;
    }
}

// loose coupling between TaxReport and TaxCalculator2018
// we can easily modify/switch TaxCalculator2018, and TaxReport will not be affected 
// One can use frameworks like Spring to manage those dependencies more effectively 
public static void main(String[] args) {
	var calculator = new TaxCalculator2018(10_000); // not allowed 
    var report = new TaxReport(calculator);
}
```



### Setter Injection  

```java
// before
public class TaxReport { 
    private TaxCalculator2018 calculator;
    public TaxReport() { 
        calculator = new TaxCalculator2018();
    }
}


// after 
public class TaxReport { 
    private TaxCalculator calculator;
    
    // constructor injection 
    public TaxReport(TaxCalculator calculator) { 
        this.calculator = calculator;
    }
    
    // we can change the dependency throughout the lifetime of the program 
    public void setCalculator(TaxCalculator TaxCalculator) {
        this.calculator = calculator;
    }
    
    public void show() {
        var tax = calculator.calculateTax();
        System.out.println(tax);
    }
}

// new calculator
public class TaxCalculator2019 implements TaxCalculator {
  @Override
  public double calculateTax() {
    return 0;
  }
}


public static void main(String[] args) {
	var calculator = new TaxCalculator2018(10_000); // not allowed 
    var report = new TaxReport(calculator);
    report.show();
    
    // change the calculator
    report.setCalculator(new TaxCalculator2019());
    report.show(); // will get different result 
}
```



### Method Injection 

```java
// before
public class TaxReport { 
    private TaxCalculator2018 calculator;
    public TaxReport() { 
        calculator = new TaxCalculator2018();
    }
}


// after 
public class TaxReport { 
    private TaxCalculator calculator;
    
    public void show(TaxCalculator calculator) {
        var tax = calculator.calculateTax();
        System.out.println(tax);
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
	var calculator = new TaxCalculator2018(10_000); // not allowed 
    var report = new TaxReport();
    
    // Pass dependence to method
    report.show(calculator);
    report.show(new TaxCalculator2019()); // will get different result 
}
```





## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

-   The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) suggests that we should **segregate or divide big, fat interfaces into smaller ones**, each focusing on a single responsibility or capability
-   Smaller interfaces are less likely to change
-   Changes to one capability, will only affect a single interface and fewer classes that depend on that interface.

```java
public interface UIWidget {
    void drag();
    void resize();
    void render();
}

public class Dragger {
    public void drag(UIWidget widget) {
        widget.drag();
        System.out.println("Drag");
    }
}

// should be 
public interface Draggable {
    void drag();
}

public class Dragger {
    public void drag(Draggable draggable) {
        draggable.drag();
        System.out.println("Drag");
    }
}

//----------------------

// use inheritance 
// interface can have multiple parents, because methods are not implementations
// there are no ambiguity
public interface UIWidget extends Draggable, Resizable {
    void render();
}

public class Dragger {
    public void drag(UIWidget draggable) {
        draggable.drag();
        System.out.println("Drag");
    }
}

public interface Resizable {
    void resize(int size);
    void resize(int x, int y);
    void resizeTo(UiWidget widget);
}
```





## Example

```java
// before
public class VideoEncoder {
    public void encode(Video video) {
        System.out.println("Encoding video...");
        System.out.println("Done!\n");
    }
}

// after 
public interface VideoEncoder {
	void encode(Video video);
}

public class XVideoEncoder implements VideoEncoder {
    @Override
    public void encode(Video video) {
        System.out.println("Encoding video...");
        System.out.println("Done!\n");
    }
}
```

-   Click `Refactor`
-   Click `Interface`
-   Click `Rename original class and use interface where possible`

```java
// before 
public class VideoProcessor {
    public void process(Video video) {
        var encoder = new VideoEncoder();
        encoder.encode(video);
    }
}

// after 
public class VideoProcessor {
    private VideoEncoder encoder;

    public VideoProcessor(VideoEncoder encoder) {
        this.encoder = encoder;
    }

    public void process(Video video) {
        encoder.encode(video);
    }
}
```



```java
// before
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var video = new Video();
        video.setFileName("birthday.mp4");
        video.setTitle("Jennifer's birthday");
        video.setUser(new User("john@domain.com"));

        var processor = new VideoProcessor();
        processor.process(video);
    }
}

// after
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var video = new Video();
        video.setFileName("birthday.mp4");
        video.setTitle("Jennifer's birthday");
        video.setUser(new User("john@domain.com"));

        var processor = new VideoProcessor(
            new XVideoEncoder(),
        );
        processor.process(video);
    }
}
```





## Bad Feature: Declare fields, static or private methods in interface

Why shouldn’t we declare fields, static or private methods in interfaces?

-   Fields, static and private methods are all about implementation
-   Interfaces are contracts and should not have any implementation.
-   Other classes should not know the implementation details of other classes 



### Declare fields in interface

```java
public interface TaxCalculator {
    // the intention is to avoid magic numbers 
    float minimumTax = 100; // final and static
    
    double calculateTax();
}

public class TaxCalculator2018 implements TaxCalculator {
    // should use the override key word
    @Override
    public double calculateTax() {     
        return TaxCalculator.minimumTax + taxableIncome * 0.3;
    }
}
```



### Declare static methods in interface

```java 
public interface TaxCalculator {   
    double calculateTax();
    
    // implementation details
    static double getTaxableIncome(double income, double expenses) {
        return income - expenses; 
    }
}


// better way: use an abstract class instead 
public interface TaxCalculator {   
    double calculateTax();
}

public abstract class AbstractTaxCalculator implements TaxCalculator {
    protected double getTaxableIncome(double income, double expenses) {
        return income - expenses; 
    }
}

// sub classes do not need to implement the interface again
public class TaxCalculator2018 extends AbstractTaxCalculator {
    // should use the override key word
    @Override
    public double calculateTax() {   
        int left = getTaxableIncome(100, 10);
        return TaxCalculator.minimumTax + taxableIncome * 0.3;
    }
}
```



### Declare private methods in interface 

```java 
public interface TaxCalculator { 
    // reason: we might end up with some repetitive logic, so can refactor our code,
    // and extract that redundent logic into a private method inside an interface (terrible) 
    private static double getTaxableIncome(double income, double expenses) {
        return income - expenses; 
    }
}
```







## Interfaces VS abstract classes

-   **Both are abstract concepts and we cannot instantiate them**
-   Interfaces are contracts and should only have method declarations
-   Abstract classes are partially-implemented classes
    -   We use them to share some common code across their derivates
-   The new features in Java allow writing code and logic in interfaces but this is a bad practice and should be avoided

-   Avoid abusing interfaces like this: (multiple inheritance)

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Sunc4127/image-hosting/202112281658647.png" alt="image-20211228165848581" style="zoom:25%;" />



## Should we extract an interface from every class?

-   Blindly extracting interfaces doesn’t solve any problems nor is it considered a best practice
-   If you extract an interface from every single class, you’ll end up with an explosion of interfaces that don’t necessarily add any values
-   **You should use interfaces in situations where you want to decouple a class from its dependencies so you can swap these dependencies**
-   This allows building applications that are extensible and testable.



### Benefits of Interfaces

#### Update Implementations for better performance

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Sunc4127/image-hosting/202112281706216.png" alt="image-20211228170612151" style="zoom:25%;" />

-   Can easily **replace** the encoding algorithm with a faster algorithm or other third party services in the future
-   Decoupling these classes so one can supply new classes in the future with minimal or zero impact on the application
-   If we do not expect to replace classes with better ones, we should not extract interfaces 



#### Extend Applications with minimum impact

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Sunc4127/image-hosting/202112281720333.png" alt="image-20211228172043288" style="zoom:25%;" />

-   Others can easily extend your applications with minimal impact 
-   Instead of programming against a concrete implementation like a concrete template engine, you program against interfaces
-   Other people can create new template engines that implement your interfaces
-   So by using interfaces, you add extensibility points to your framework



#### Test classes in isolation

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Sunc4127/image-hosting/202112281723113.png" alt="image-20211228172332053" style="zoom:25%;" />

-   Decouple classes from dependencies and test this class in isolation 

-   This is what we call unit testing 

-   If you don't practice unit testing in your organization then extracting these interfaces doesn't really give you any benefits

     

#### Reminder

-   So once again, don't just blindly write code and follow these so called best practices because someone told you to do so
-   For every piece of code you write you need to understand the problem you're trying to solve. 
-   If you are not solving any problems, you are wasting your time and not adding any values
-   In fact, you are increasing the cost, because the more code you write the more bugs you're going to create, and the maintenance of your applications is going to be more costly
