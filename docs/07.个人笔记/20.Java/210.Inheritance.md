## Inheritance

-   Use ```extends``` to indicate that class A inherits from class B

## The `Object` Class

-   All classes extends from the `Object` class 
    -   don't  need to state the obvious
    -   i.e. ```public class main extends Object```
-   It provides useful methods 





## `hashCode()` function

-   The ```hashCode()``` methods **returns a numeric value that is calculated based on the address of the object in memory**. 

```java
var point1 = new Point(1, 2); 
var point2 = new Point(1, 2); 
System.out.println(point1.equals(point2)); // false
System.out.println(point1.hashCode() == point2.hashCode()) // false
```

-   Even though point1 and point2 have the same coordinates, the default implementation of the ```equals()``` method compares objects for reference equality. 

-   These two objects are **in two different locations in memory**, that’s why the ```equals()``` method returns `false`. 

    

```java
var point1 = new Point(1, 2); 
var point2 = point1; 
System.out.println(point1.hashCode() == point2.hashCode()); // true
```





## Constructor

-   A ==Default Constructor== is a constructor **without any parameters**
    -   If we don’t create it, the Java compiler will automatically add one to our classes. 

-   i.e. ```public Constomer(String name) {}```
    -   constructors **don’t have a return type, not even void**. 
-   To create a constructor
    -   Click `Code`
    -   Click `Generate`
    -   Click `Constructor`





## The ```super``` keyword

-   The super keyword is a **reference to the base or parent class**. 

-   We can **use it to access the members (fields and methods) or call the constructors of the base class**
-   In contrast, the ```this``` keyword returns a reference to the current object. 

```java
// Super class 
public abstract class UIControl {
  private boolean isEnabled = true;

  public UIControl(boolean isEnabled) {
    this.isEnabled = isEnabled;
  }
}

// Sub class 
public class TextBox extends UIControl {
  private String text = "";

  public TextBox() {
    // pass boolean value to the super class 
    super(true);
  }
}
```



## `Private` and `protected` access modifiers

-   Members marked with protected or private access modifiers are only accessible inside of a class. 

-   **Protected** members are **inherited** and **are accessible by child (derived) classes**. 
    -   If we **omit** the access modifier, the member will have the **default access modifier** which makes that member **public in package**. 
    -   In other words, that member will **be public in the package but private outside of the package**. 
-   **Private** fields cannot be inherited by sub classes and are not accessible outside of the class 
    -   Its implementation detail is hidden





## Method Overriding

-   **Method overriding** means **changing the implementation** of an inherited method in a subclass. 
    -   For example, we can override the ```equals()``` or ```hashCode()``` methods of the Object class. 

-   **Method overloading** means declaring a method with **different signatures** (different number, type and order of parameters).  

```java
public class TextBox extends UIControl {
  private String text = "";
    
  // Override the default toString method
  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return text;
  }

  public void setText(String text) {
    this.text = text;
  }
}


public static void main(String[] args) {
    var textBox = new TextBox();
    textBox.setText("Hello world");
    
    // Can ignore the '.toStrong()' part 
    System.out.println(textBox);
}
```





## `@Override` annotation

The benefit of applying the ```@Override``` annotation when overriding a method:

-   It **signals the Java compiler that we are overriding a method** in the base class and this helps the compiler check our code for correctness. 

-   It will ensure the **signature** of the method in the subclass **matches** the on declared in the base class. 
-   Also, if we remove this method from the base class, the compiler will let us know and we can remove the method in the subclass as well.





## Upcasting and Downcasting

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Sunc4127/image-hosting/202112251546011.png" alt="image-20211225154615936" style="zoom: 25%;" />

Q: The Customer class inherits from the User class. Can we pass a Customer object to this method? Why?

```java
public void print(User user) {}
```

-   Yes. We can pass an instance of any classes that inherit directly or indirectly from the User class. 
-   In this case, the **customer** object will get automatically **upcast** (meaning it’ll get converted to its base type - **User**). 
-   If we need to work with members of the customer object in this method, we need to explicitly **downcast** it by prefixing the object with (Customer).

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    var control = new UIControl(true);
    var textBox = new TextBox();
}

public static void show(UIControl control) {
    // since in textBox, toString is overidden, need to specify its type
    if (control instanceof TextBox) {
        // downcast it by prefixing the object
        var textBox = (TextBox) control;
        textBox.setText("Hello World!");
    }
    System.out.println(control);
}
```

```instanceof``` operator: 

-   It **tells us if an object is an instance of a class.** 
-   We use it before casting an object to a different type to make sure we don’t get a casting exception.  





## Comparing Objects

-   Click ```Command + N```
-   Select ```equals() and hashCode()```

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    var point1 = new Point(1, 2);
    var point2 = new Point(1, 2);
    System.out.println(point1 == point2); // return false, because their address are different 
    ystem.out.println(point1.equals(point2)); // this is the right way
}

public class Point {
    private int x;
    private int y;
    
    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
    
    // use Command + N, and click "Override methods" to override the equals() method
    @Override 
    public boolean equals(Object obj) {
        // check address to determine obj is the object itself
        if (this == object)
            return true;
        // safety check 
        if (!(obj instanceof Point))
            return false;
        
        var other = (Point) obj;
        return other.x == x && other.y == y;
    }
    
    // generated not based on the address of the object in memory, but based on the content of the object
    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(x, y);
    }
}
```





## Four principles of **object-oriented programming**

-   **Encapsulation**: **bundling** the data and operations on the data inside **a single unit (class)**.  
-   **Abstraction**: **reducing complexity** by hiding unnecessary details (metaphor: the implementation detail of a remote control is hidden from us. We only work with its public interface.)  
-   **Inheritance**: a mechanism for **reusing** code.  
-   **Polymorphism**: a mechanism that **allows an object to take many forms and behave differently**. This will help us build **extensible** applications. 





## Polymorphism

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Sunc4127/image-hosting/202112251618407.png" alt="image-20211225161808345" style="zoom:25%;" />

-   **Polymorphism**: a mechanism that **allows an object to take many forms and behave differently**. This will help us build **extensible** applications. 

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       UIControl[] controls = { new TextBox(), new CheckBox() };
       // control takes many form
       for (var control : controls)
           control.render();
    }
}

// super class
public abstract class UIControl {
  public abstract void render();
}

// sub class 
public class TextBox extends UIControl {
  @Override
  public void render() {
    System.out.println("Render TextBox");
  }
}

// sub class 
public final class CheckBox extends UIControl {
  @Override
  public void render() {
    System.out.println("Render CheckBox");
  }
}
```





## `abstract` classes and methods

```java
public abstract class UIControl {
    public abstract void render(); // classes inherited the UIControl class must implement the method
}
```

-   An abstract class is a **partially-implemented** (half-cooked) class
-   We **cannot instantiate them** because it is an abstract concept
-   But we use them to **share** some common code across their subclasses

-   An abstract class **does not need abstract methods**
    -   This means we can have an abstract class without any abstract methods
    -   **But if we mark a method as abstract, we should mark the class as abstract as well**
-   Classes inherited a abstract class must implement all methods of that class 



##  ```final``` classes

-   Final classes **cannot be inherited (extended)**
-   We use them when we’ve made certain **assumptions** about a class and we want to **prevent other classes extending our class** and break those assumptions.  
-   **Normally not used** because it breaks object-oriented programming principles 
-   e.g. `String` class is `final`, because strings are **immutable**, and its methods has many assumptions 
    -   Once initialized, cannot change its content

-   Final methods cannot be overridden
    -   Don't want assumptions been broken 






## Deep Inheritance Hierarchies

-   Should be one or two levels, no more than three levels

Consequences of Tightly couple classes to each other

-   This means if one wants to modify `Entity`, they may need to modify all classes that are inherited from `Entity`
-   Any changes will cause all subclasses to be recompiled and redeployed 
-   Some methods don't make sense to other classes (Polluting hierarchy with irrelevant stuff) 

Right way:

-   Delete the `User` abstract class
    -   Cost: Duplicate code a little bit
-   Delete both `RegularInstructor` and `PremiumInstrutor`
    -   Use a boolean value instead 





## Multiple Inheritance

-   **Java does not support multiple inheritance** because it is troublesome:

-   It's ambiguous which `sayHello()` c should inherit

## The Diamond Problem

<img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Sunc4127/image-hosting/202112251653909.png" alt="image-20211225165345865" style="zoom:25%;" />

-   The diamond problem **happens in languages that support multiple inheritance**. 
-   If two classes (B, C) derive from A and are also the parents of another class (D), we see a diamond. 
-   If the top class (A) declares a method (eg toString) and its children (B and C) override this method, it’s **not clear which implementation will be inherited by D.**
