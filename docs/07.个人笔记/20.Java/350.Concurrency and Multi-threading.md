## Process and Threads 

-   A `process` is an instance of a program or an application 
    -   The operating system loads an application inside a process 
        -   The OS can execute many processes at the same time
    -   Process contains an image of application code 
    -   It has some memory and other resources 
-   A `thread` is a sequence of instructions within a process (A thread of instructions)
    -   Each process has at least one thread called the `main thread`
    -   More processes can be created to run tasks concurrently 
    -   e.g. build a web server that can serve many clients at the same time 
        -   Serve each client using a separate thread (`Multiple Treading`)
        -   Multi-threaded Application 
        -   Multi-core computers can run many processes or threads 

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Thread.activeCount()); 
        // 2: 1 is the main thread, the other is the background thread that runs the garbage collector
        // garbage collector removes unused objects from memory 
        System.out.println(Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors());
        // 8 (we have 8 available but we just used 2 of them; the number depends on your machine)
    }
}
```
