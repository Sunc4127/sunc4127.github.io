## Process and Threads 

-   A `process` is an instance of a program or an application 
    -   The operating system loads an application inside a process 
        -   The OS can execute many processes at the same time
    -   Process contains an image of application code 
    -   It has some memory and other resources 
-   A `thread` is a sequence of instructions within a process (A thread of instructions)
    -   Each process has at least one thread called the `main thread`
    -   More processes can be created to run tasks concurrently 
    -   e.g. build a web server that can serve many clients at the same time 
        -   Serve each client using a separate thread (`Multiple Treading`)
        -   Multi-threaded Application 
        -   Multi-core computers can run many processes or threads 

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Thread.activeCount()); 
        // 2: 1 is the main thread, the other is the background thread that runs the garbage collector
        // garbage collector removes unused objects from memory 
        System.out.println(Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors());
        // 8 (we have 8 available but we just used 2 of them; the number depends on your machine)
    }
}
```





## Starting a Thread

```java
public class ThreadDemo {
    public static void show() {
        // current thread name is different from the download thread 
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()); 
        
        for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
			Thread thread = new Thread(new DownloadFileTask());
        	therad.start(); // these threads have different names; they run in parallel
        }
    }
}

public class DownloadFileTask implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Downloading a file: "+Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }

}
```





## Pausing a Thread 

```java
public class DownloadFileTask implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {        
        // We can put a thread to sleep, so it takes 50 seconds to finish 10 download
        try {
          Thread.sleep(5000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
```

-   Thread scheduling: if have more tasks then threads, scheduler will switch among tasks, giving each a slice of CPU time, giving one the illusion that they are run in parallel 



## Joining a Thread

```java
public class ThreadDemo {
    public static void show() {       
        Thread thread = new Thread(new DownloadFileTask());
        therad.start();
        
        // let the main thread to wait for the completion
        // block current main thread from doing any other things 
        try {
          Thread.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```





## Interrupting a Thread

```java
public class ThreadDemo {
    public static void show() {       
        Thread thread = new Thread(new DownloadFileTask());
        therad.start();
        
        try {
          Thread.sleep(1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
        }
        
        thread.interrupt(); // does not force thread to stop
        // it sends an interrupt request 
        // thread needs to handle that request
    }
}

public class DownloadFileTask implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {        
        for (var i = 0; i < 10_000; i++)
            // handle interruption
            if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) return;
  
    }

}
```





## Concurrency Issues

-   `Race Condition`: multiple threads are competing to modify some data 
-   `Visibility Problem`: different threads have different views of the shared data as changes are not visible to other threads
-   Therefore, we need `Thread-safe Code`



## Race Conditions

```java
package com.codewithmosh.concurrency;

import java.util.concurrent.atomic.LongAdder;

public class DownloadStatus {
    private int totalFiles;

    public int getTotalBytes() {
        return totalBytes.intValue();
    }

    public void incrementTotalBytes() {
        totalBytes.increment();
    }
}

public class ThreadDemo {
    public static void show() {       
        var status = new DownloadStatus();
        
        List<Thread> threads = new ArrayList<>();
        
        
        for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Thread thread = new Thread(new DownloadFileTask(status));
            thread.start();
            threads.add(thread);
        }
        
        // wait for all download threads to finish 
        for(var thread : threads) {
            try {
                Thread.join();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class DownloadFileTask implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (var i = 0; i < 10_000; i++) {
            if (Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) return;
            status.incrementTotalBytes();
            // race condition, the total bytes will be different each time we run
        }
    }

}
```





## Strategies for Thread Safety 

-   `Confinement` : not to share data across threads in the first place
    -   confine or restrict each thread to have its own data 
-   `Immutability` : use immutable or unchangeable objects 
    -   An object is `immutable` if its data cannot be changed after creation
    -   These are read-only objects 
-   `Synchronization` : Prevent multiple threads from accessing the same object concurrently 
    -   Synchronize or coordinate the access to an object across different threads by using locks
    -   Only one thread at a time can change that part 
    -   It is against the idea of concurrency 
    -   Implementing synchronization is challenging error-prone
        -   Deadlock: two threads wait for each other indefinitely 
    -   This is bad, avoid it as much as possible
-   `Atomic Objects` : these classes allow us to achieve thread-safety without using locks 
    -   They are like atoms, they cannot be broken down
-   `Partitioning` : partition data into segments that can be accessed concurrently
    -   Multiple threads can access a collection of object, but only one thread at a time can access a segment in that collection
